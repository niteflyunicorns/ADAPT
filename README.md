# ADAPT
Anomaly Detection in Asteroid Patterns and Trends

## What is ADAPT?
ADAPT is a processing system that will be responsible for processing incoming streams of astronomical data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, filtering out individual asteroids whose behavior appears to be deviating from their normal behavior. The goal is for ADAPT to detect early warning signs for changes to an asteroidâ€™s behavior and send alerts to the astronomy community in advance so that astronomers can potentially observe these changes as they are happening.

## How does it work?
Currently, we are in the process of figuring out what the early warning signs are and what the best algorithm (or combination of algorithms) is to detect these signs.
