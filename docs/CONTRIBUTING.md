# Welcome to the ADAPT contributing guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ADAPT project!

Due to the current size of the project, if you are interested in contributing, your best bet is to reach out to the [maintainer](<https://github.com/niteflyunicorns>) and they will guide you through the setup and contribution process. Of course, there are other ways to contribute aside from working with the ADAPT codebase, which are detailed in the following sections.

## Reporting Bugs:
If you spot a bug in the ADAPT repository or its supporting documentation, we kindly ask that you report it to the maintainer so that we can fix it! To report bugs, please follow the guidelines below:

1. Open a new issue using the bug-report template
2. Fill out as much detail you can, especially when describing the steps to reproduce the bug. This will help us respond quickly and keep our repository as bug-free as possible.
3. Submit your issue, and if you don't hear from the maintainer within a week, feel free to reach out with a gentle reminder. 

## Research!
We are always happy to hear about new research in the field. If you are a researcher, or come across related research in the wild, please send it our way! You can do this in two different ways:
1. Open an issue with the `research` label, and upload the link there. This way, you can add reasonings, explanations, ideas, etc., in the body of the issue, and there is a permanent record of your contribution in the repository.
2. Reach out to the ADAPT [maintainer](<https://github.com/niteflyunicorns>) to share the research independent of the repository.

## Documentation:
Our documentation is not perfect, and there is no guarantee that it will always be up-to-date. If you see an issue, even something as small as a typo, please open a `docs` issue and let us know! We will do our best to keep the important things updated, but this helps us with the little things!

## Anything else:
If you have an idea of a way to contribute that is not covered here, please reach out to the [maintainer](<https://github.com/niteflyunicorns>) - we are always happy to hear from potential contributors.
